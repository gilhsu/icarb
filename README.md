# iCarb Pizza

iCarb is an online food ordering experience built in React with Redux and React Router.

Redux is a state container for Javascript applications that allows platforms to persist and share data across components in a consistant and predictable way. While there are infinite ways to demonstrate the power of centrally held state, none seems more practical, and tasty, than a pizza ordering experience.
